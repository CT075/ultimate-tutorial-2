# Beginning a Project

*Note: Many of the tools you will be using are made for Windows. If you have
OSX or Linux you may want to consider a VM or Dual Boot setup.* First, you will
set up your **project folder**. Create a new folder wherever you want, and name
it your project name.

**Note: Do not use special characters such as "`[]+-`" in your folder name.**

#### For the rest of the tutorial, I will refer to this folder as **Root**.

Next, download the latest version of
**[Event Assembler](http://feuniverse.us/t/event-assembler/1749?u=circleseverywhere)**
from FE Universe, and place the folder in Root.

You will also want a **Hex Editor** of some sort installed on your computer.
This does not need to be in the Root folder. **HxD** is a good, free hex editor
that is more than enough for our purposes.

Although you can get away with using plain old Notepad, a good text editor such
as Notepad++ or Sublime Text will make your life much easier. Personally, I'm
quite partial to Sublime Text thanks to its [syntax highlighting for Event
Assembler code](http://feuniverse.us/t/syntax-highlighting-for-event-assembler/2131?u=circleseverywhere).

Create a new, empty **text file** in Root. Name it `ROM Buildfile.txt`. This
simple text file will become the ***backbone of your entire project.***

Finally, place your **clean ROM** in Root. Mine is called `FE8_clean.gba` but
you can substitute whatever yours is.

#### Your **folder structure** should look like:
>  - `Root` 
  - `Event Assembler` 
  - `ROM Buildfile.txt` 
  - `FE8_clean.gba` 

Now youâ€™re ready to get started!
