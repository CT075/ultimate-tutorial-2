# Fire Emblem Ultimate Tutorial v2

## Introduction
**If you’re reading this,** you are probably an aspiring rom hacker who thinks it would be **really cool** to make a Fire Emblem game. Maybe you’re a bit intimidated by how much there is to learn, but you’ve decided to **give it a shot** anyway. Lucky for you, you’ve come to the right place. FE hacking is one of the most **enjoyable** and **rewarding** hobbies I’ve come across, and the community is friendly, welcoming, and filled with amazingly talented people. 

The original **Ultimate Tutorial** by Blazer was and is a fantastic resource for anyone who wants to get into Fire Emblem romhacking. However, it has not been updated since 2013 and is primarily aimed at FE7 hacking. Since then, there have been some **significant advances** in rom hacking. The hacking process is very different from what it used to be, both in terms of tools required and also how projects are managed.

This guide aims to be an **all-in-one** tutorial for all steps of the hacking process, with a particular focus on managing a **complete project** rather than making individual changes. Most parts of this guide are applicable to both FE7 and FE8, and to some extent FE6. This guide is a **work in progress**, so for the moment it is assumed that you are hacking FE8.
